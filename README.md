## projects
This repository plays as part of my portfolio. It holds projects, that I consider as purely educational. Serious and fully-authorized ones will be moved to independent repositories.
Projects here are either of the below:
 - classified by myself as too small to move to independent directories;
 - unfinished initiatives, drafts;
 - found somewhere, read, digested and rewritten for learning and practice.
